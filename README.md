## **!weather 'location'**

Can be called in the format '!weather 00000' for zip code, or '!weather City Name', and will return a basic overview of the weather for that area!
Please note, in the case of City Name, only major cities can be queried, so it is recommended you use zip code.



## **@Kovabotv2 'stuff to say'**

Can be called in the format '@Kovabotv2 stuff to say'. The space between text is necessary to get a proper query. 
Please note, I have literally no control over what the response will be.
