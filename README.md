# Kovabotv2
A simple twitch chat bot using the tmi.js library written in node.js.





# **Commands explanation**

Commands begin with the character '!' and unless otherwise stated, a command will not work with any additional text entered.




## **!hi**

A basic welcome message will be sent as a response!



## **!twitter**

The streamer's twitter handle will be linked. Give them a follow!



## **!github**

The streamer's github page will be linked. May not work for all streamers.



## **!ree**

The bot will REE in rage!



## **!weather 'location'**

Can be called in the format '!weather 00000' for zip code, or '!weather City Name', and will return a basic overview of the weather for that area!
Please note, in the case of City Name, only major cities can be queried, so it is recommended you use zip code.



## **!alert**

This is a command to directly email me an alert if there is an issue with the bot.



## **!define 'word'**

Can be called in the format '!define word', and will return a definition of the word.



## **@Kovabotv2 'stuff to say'**

This has been disabled until further notice.

Can be called in the format '@Kovabotv2 stuff to say', and is used to... have a conversation with the bot. 
Please note, I have literally no control over what the response will be.
