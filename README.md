hi, twitter, github, ree, !weather, !kovabot, !commands

**!hi**
A basic welcome message will be sent as a response!

**!twitter**
The streamer's twitter handle will be linked. Give them a follow!

**github**
The streamer's github page will be linked. May not work for all streamers.

**!ree**
The bot will REE in rage!

**!weather 'location'**
Can be called in the format '!weather 00000' for zip code, or '!weather City Name', and will return a basic overview of the weather for that area!
Please note, in the case of City Name, only major cities can be queried, so it is recommended you use zip code.
